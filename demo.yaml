The mother claims the child is feeling ill, eating poorly, has no energy, and is suffering from diarrhea over the course of two days.

                    While a nice thing to do, this is not
                    the best choice at this time. Your focus
                    should be on the child.

                    Incorrect. The temperature is normal,
